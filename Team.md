## Principal Investigator
#### Dr. Stuart Linley
##### Assistant Professor

<p align="justify"><img style="margin-right: 1rem;margin-top: 0.5rem" align="left" src="/assets/Images/StuartHeadshot2023_cropped.jpg" width="280"> Stuart is a chemical and materials engineer from southern Ontario who has been researching functional materials for environmental applications for over a decade. He graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering in 2014 and a PhD in Chemical Engineering - Nanotechnology in 2019 under the supervision of <a href="https://www.frankgulab.com">Frank Gu</a>. During his PhD, he co-founded water treatment start-up company <a href="https://www.h2nano.ca/">H2nanO</a> to scale functional materials for sustainable water treatment. He worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Neil Thomson at the University of Waterloo from 2019-2020. From 2020-2023, he held an NSERC postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, working with <a href="http://www-reisner.ch.cam.ac.uk/">Erwin Reisner</a></p>

<p align="justify"> 
Stuart's specific research pursuits have included reusable photocatalyst composites for wastewater treatment and solar reforming, nanoparticles with functional polymer coatings for targeted delivery to subsurface and groundwater contaminants, and synthesis techniques for inorganic nano- and microscale colloids.

## Graduate Students
#### Alibek Kurbanov
##### MASc - Chemical Engineering

<p align="justify"><img style="margin-right: 1rem;margin-top: 0.5rem" align="right" src="/assets/Images/Alibek_Kurbanov_Headshot.jpg" width="280"> Alibek Kurbanov is from Turkmenistan and completed his B.Eng in Chemical Engineering at Tianjin University in China under a fully funded CSC scholarship. He has a background in photocatalysis with two co-authored publications on developing catalytic materials for hydrogen evolution from ammonia-borane using a Pt@Ni<sub>2</sub>PC<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub> photocatalyst (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijhydene.2023.03.218">International Journal of Hydrogen Energy, 2023</a>) and Au nanoparticles for enhanced charge transfer (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2023.01.122">Journal of Colloid and Interface Science, 2023</a>).</p>
  
<p align="justify">Alibek is currently pursuing his MASc in Chemical Engineering at McMaster University. His research focuses on developing floating carbon nitride-based photocatalysts for solar-driven hydrogen production and wastewater treatment. Outside the lab, Alibek is a table tennis player and regularly competes in local tournaments across Ontario.</p>
