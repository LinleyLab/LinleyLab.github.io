<img style="margin-right: 1rem" style="margin-top: 1rem" align="left" src="/assets/Images/StuartHeadshot2023_cropped.jpg" width="280">Stuart is a chemical and materials engineer from southern Ontario who has been researching functional materials for environmental applications for over a decade. He graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering in 2014 and a PhD in Chemical Engineering - Nanotechnology in 2019 under the supervision of [Frank Gu](https://www.frankgulab.com). During his PhD, he co-founded water treatment start-up company [H2nanO](https://www.h2nano.ca/) to scale functional materials for sustainable water treatment. He worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Neil Thomson at the University of Waterloo from 2019-2020. From 2020-2023, he held an NSERC postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, working with [Erwin Reisner](http://www-reisner.ch.cam.ac.uk/).

Stuart's specific research pursuits have included reusable photocatalyst composites for wastewater treatment and solar reforming, nanoparticles with functional polymer coatings for targeted delivery to subsurface and groundwater contaminants, and synthesis techniques for inorganic nano- and microscale colloids. A list of Stuart's publications can be found here.
