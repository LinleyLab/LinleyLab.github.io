<p align="justify"><img style="margin-right: 1rem;margin-top: 0.5rem" align="left" src="/assets/Images/StuartHeadshot2023_cropped.jpg" width="280"> Stuart is a chemical and materials engineer from southern Ontario who has been researching functional materials for environmental applications for over a decade. He graduated from the University of Waterloo with a BASc in Nanotechnology Engineering in 2014 and a PhD in Chemical Engineering - Nanotechnology in 2019 under the supervision of <a href="https://www.frankgulab.com">Frank Gu</a>. During his PhD, he co-founded water treatment start-up company <a href="https://www.h2nano.ca/">H2nanO</a> to scale functional materials for sustainable water treatment. He worked as a postdoctoral researcher with Neil Thomson at the University of Waterloo from 2019-2020. From 2020-2023, he held an NSERC postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry, working with <a href="http://www-reisner.ch.cam.ac.uk/">Erwin Reisner</a></p>
