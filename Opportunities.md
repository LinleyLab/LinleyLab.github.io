### Develop and apply new photocatalyst composites

Investigate combinations of catalysts and supports to develop robust, re-usable photocatalyst materials. Explore catalyst
functionalization and modification strategies to improve light utilization, reaction kinetics, and production rates.
Gain experience with a wide variety of synthetic techniques, then characterize materials before and after composite
application. Identify leading composite candidates and scale production for wastewater treatment and solar reforming applications.

### Investigate solar reforming of real and model waste

Using standard photocatalyst materials, explore solar reforming on a variety of model waste compounds. Characterize and quantify
organic by-products and H<sub>2</sub> production rates to gain insight on how waste composition and solvent matrix affect the
reforming process. Investigate physical and chemical pre-treatment methods on real and model waste compounds to expand the
scope of solar reforming application.

### Build and optimize solar reforming reactors

Design reactors for optimized solar reforming by incorporating light management, gas collection, continuous operation, and 
feedback control. Model reactor performance supported by empirical data and investigate how design can improve waste treatment,
value product generation, process rates, and resilience under natural operating conditions. Perform technoeconomic analyses to
predict the value of solar reforming systems in a technological transition.
