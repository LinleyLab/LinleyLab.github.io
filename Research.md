Our research team is investigating functional materials for sustainability applications

## Photocatalyst Composites

Photocatalysts are materials or molecules that absorb light and use that energy to drive chemical reactions. Our team is exploring
how heterogenous photocatalysts can be improved through modification and incorporation into functional composites. For example, 
by attaching photocatalysts to low-density supports we can make a material that floats in water, is easy to re-use, and concentrates the
photocatalyst at the surface of the water. By incorporating magnetic nanoparticles in a photocatalyst composite, we can collect the
photocatalyst with a strong magnetic field. These changes make our photocatalysts more useful than they are on their own.

## Solar Photocatalytic Reforming

Solar reforming (SR) is a sunlight-driven process that enables circular use of waste carbon by transforming it into useful products.
This can be done using photocatalysts (or photocatalyst composites) to drive oxidation and reduction reactions. The catalyst can donate
electrons to make high-energy molecules and accept electrons to break down waste. This means we can simultaneously treat wastewater 
containing organic contaminants and produce CO<sub>2</sub>-free fuels such as H<sub>2</sub>.
