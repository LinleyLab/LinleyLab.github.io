    <h2>Sustainability</h2>

    <p align="justify">
      Our every day life is made possible through thousands of different chemicals - everything from your dish soap to your t-shirts are derived from oil-based chemicals. The expansive chemicals industry accounts for 30% of industrial energy use and 14% of global oil demand, half of which is used as feedstock material. Much of what we create was never intended for perpetual use: every year, consumers discard 2 billion tonnes of waste, of which 1.4 billion tonnes goes directly to landfill.
    </p>
    
    <p align="justify">
      Some of our most materially wasteful commodities are fuels. By producing fuels from fossil feedstocks, every year we release 8.1 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents into the atmosphere. Even our leading fuel replacement, H<sub>2</sub> is carbon-positive, with 95% of hydrogen on the market produced from methane:

      To improve the sustainability of our economy, we need to consider how industry and consumer waste can be chemically reformed to create new commodities. This 'circular economy' treats waste as a resource and uses renewable sources of energy to limit emissions and create value.
    </p>

    <p align="justify">
      The Linley Lab is working on direct sunlight-powered solutions for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from waste carbon to reduce the environmental impact of industry. Our core interest is solar reforming, a photocatalytic process that uses electrons from waste carbon to produce high-energy molecules like H<sub>2</sub>.
