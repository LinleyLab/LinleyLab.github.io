    <h3>Sustainability</h3>
    <hr>
    Our every day life is made possible through thousands of different chemicals - everything from your dish soap to your t-shirts are derived from oil-based chemicals. The expansive chemicals industry accounts for 30% of   industrial energy use and 14% of global oil demand, half of which is used as feedstock material. Much of what we create was never intended for perpetual use: every year, consumers discard 2 billion tonnes of waste, of which 1.4 billion tonnes goes directly to landfill.

    Some of our most materially wasteful commodities are fuels. By producing fuels from fossil feedstocks, every year we release 8.1 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents into the atmosphere. Even our leading fuel replacement, H<sub>2</sub> is carbon-positive, with 95% of hydrogen on the market produced from methane:

    To improve the sustainability of our economy, we need to consider how industry and consumer waste can be chemically reformed to create new commodities. This 'circular economy' treats waste as a resource and uses renewable sources of energy to limit emissions and create value.

    The Linley Lab is working on direct sunlight-powered solutions for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from waste carbon to reduce the environmental impact of industry. Our core interest is solar reforming, a photocatalytic process that uses electrons from waste carbon to produce high-energy molecules like H<sub>2</sub>.
