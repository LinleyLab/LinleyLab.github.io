### The Linear Economy

Our every day life is made possible through thousands of different chemicals - everything from your dish soap to your t-shirts are derived from oil-based chemicals. The expansive chemicals industry accounts for 30% of industrial energy use and 14% of global oil demand, half of which is used as feedstock material. Every year, consumers discard 2 billion tonnes of waste, of which 1.4 billion tonnes goes directly to landfill.

By producing fuels from fossil feedstocks, every year we release 8.1 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents into the atmosphere. Even our leading fuel replacement, H<sub>2</sub> is carbon-positive, with 95% of hydrogen on the market produced from methane:

The Linley Lab is working on direct sunlight-powered solutions for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from waste carbon to reduce the environmental impact of industry. Our core interest is solar reforming, a photocatalytic process that uses electrons from waste carbon to produce high-energy molecules like H<sub>2</sub>.
