**Sustainable Fuels and Chemicals**

The chemicals industry accounts for 30% of industrial energy use and 14% of global oil demand, half of which is used as feedstocks to make the chemicals we need for every day life.

Every year, consumers discard 2 billion tonnes of waste, of which 1.4 billion tonnes goes directly to landfill.

By producing fuels from fossil feedstocks, every year we dump the equivalent of 8.1 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> into the atmosphere. Even our leading fuel replacement, H<sub>2</sub> is carbon-positive, with 95% of hydrogen on the market produced from methane:

The Linley Lab is working on direct sunlight-powered solutions for sustainable production of fuels and chemicals from waste carbon to reduce the environmental impact of industry. Our core interest is solar reforming, a photocatalytic process that uses electrons from waste carbon to produce high-energy molecules like H<sub>2</sub>.
